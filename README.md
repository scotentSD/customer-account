# Customer Portal Account

## Context
- There has been previous work done on a customer portal account in the last years. 
- Many of our services requires an account in one form or another, and we can’t keep create different accounts for each of them
- Having a single account for our customers makes things easier for them but also for us as it will be easier to maintain
